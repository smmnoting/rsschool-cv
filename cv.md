## About me
Hi! I'm a 24-years-old physician who is highly interested in programming. In my opinion, self-educating as well as team work are my strongest abilities.
This summer I've just graduated from web-programming retraining courses and now I continue my studies on defferent courses. I believe that competitive atmosphere is the best environment for professional growth.
